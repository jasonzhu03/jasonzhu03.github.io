## About

The goal of this course is to provide students a hands-on understanding of classical data analysis techniques and to develop proficiency in applying these techniques in modern programming languages (Python).

The course introduces students to a wide range of techniques that are commonly used in the analysis of data such as clustering, classification, regression, and neural networks.

Note that this is not a Python (or an introduction to programming) course, so self-study will be necessary for those students who do not already know the language.

There is no textbook for this course, all material will be made available online.
